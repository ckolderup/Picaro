class Object
  # An object is blank if it's false, empty, or a whitespace string.
  # For example, "", "   ", +nil+, [], and {} are all blank.
  #
  # This simplifies:
  #
  #   if address.nil? || address.empty?
  #
  # ...to:
  #
  #   if address.blank?
  def blank?
    respond_to?(:empty?) ? empty? : !self
  end

  # An object is present if it's not <tt>blank?</tt>.
  def present?
    !blank?
